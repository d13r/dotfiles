# Reference files

The `.txt` files in this folder can be read (and edited) from the CLI:

```bash
ref <topic>
ref <topic> edit
ref <topic> delete
```

This is designed to work like [`tldr`](https://tldr.sh/).

In general though, I prefer to create aliases/scripts so I don't have to look
things up.
